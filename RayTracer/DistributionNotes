notes on some distributions for sampling:

. one is the dirac function where you can change the size of the spike, its like a choosing distribution. Really its the normal distribution
you can pick where the mean is then how fast it falls off, if it falls off fast then its like a dirac and you almost pick out one direction, might be good
for specular mirror reflection or if you make it wider then it will priotize the ones around middle. Useful to have

. another is the exponential possion looking ones that priortize one "side" of the domain and it falls of exponentially or close to

. uniform of course, default one

. sigmoid distribution

. kumaraswamy a=.5, b=.5 looks cool it prioritozies both the edges sharply then it turns into a uniform in the middle

. u-quadratic distribution, is a quadratic, creates more on the boundaries and almost linearlly falls off until 0 is at the middle

. planck distribution, could be useful for energy equations or conversions

. chauchy distribution, a normal looking distribution with more at the endpoints and not as big of a middle
